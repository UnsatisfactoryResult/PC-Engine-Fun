I added a capacitor map for the NEC Core Grafx console.

I have included datasheets for the various capacitors used. I made an educated guess about the small one on the hucard board based on size and time of manufacture.

I also am guessing on the Rubycon capacitors used. The original used SSA series which was superceded by the TWSS series. While the SSAs were marked, these are not. Image searches show identical looking capacitors. They're also refered to as CE W, but I don't think this is correct. Old capacitors were sometimes marked CE to refer to radial leads or just to designate it as an electrolytic. 

Hey, at least the sole Chemi-Con is clearly marked.
