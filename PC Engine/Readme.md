I've added the capacitor map for the original white NEC PC Engine.

I've included the datasheets for the Nichicon VX series capacitors. The little capacitor on the hucard board does not have a series marking, but time of manufacture and size leads me to believe it's an MA series.

I can't find a datasheet for the Rubycon SSA series. It was superceded with the TWSS series, so I'm including that.

I also can't find a datasheet for the Panasonic SU series. It was replaced with the M series which I also can't find a datasheet for.
