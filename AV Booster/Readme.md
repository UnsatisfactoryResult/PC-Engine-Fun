I have added a DigiKey list using Panasonic M-A series capacitors for easy ordering if anyone needs to recap their AV Booster.

The original capacitors are all Nichicon VX series, which was just a basic general purpose capacitor.
I was able to dig up a datasheet, so feel free to take a look if you're curious.

I added some board and case pictures. They're not the best, but you should be able to get a good ideal.
The board pictures were taken after I recapped the board. There was no visible venting of the old, nor did I test them.

Be warned, this thing is not easy to get apart and back together. There are no screws, just locking tabs with very stiff plastic.
