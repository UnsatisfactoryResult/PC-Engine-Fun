I've added the capacitor map for the original white NEC PC Engine.

I've included the datasheets for the Nichicon VX series capacitors. The little capacitor on the hucard board does not have a series marking, but time of manufacture and size leads me to believe it's an MA series.

I cannot find a datasheet for the Rubycon SSA series. It was replaced with the TWSS series, so I'm including that as well.

I can't find a datasheet for the Panasonic SU series. I was replaced with the M series that I also can't find a datasheet for.
